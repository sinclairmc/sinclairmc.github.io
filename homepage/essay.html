        <h1 style="Text-align: center; font-family: Helvetica; background-color: padding: 5px:">The Verrazzano View</h1>
         <p style="Text-align: center; margin-right: ($spacer * 2) !important; padding: 200px:">The Verrazzano Bridge was nothing special to me for so long. I viewed it as a ten minute process of getting from Brooklyn to Staten Island to go see my grandma, a process I have done for over 10 years. I would recognize it was a pretty view because my dad would mention it every single time we drove over it, or by it. I would also notice it was pretty on my morning summer runs. But I never gave it much thought past that.
	<p style="Text-align: center; margin-left: ($spacer * 4) !important: padding: 200px:"> I never noticed how it contrasted so well with the water and the sky before. I never noticed how bright the lights were at night. I never noticed how cumulus clouds made it so much more engaging. I never noticed any of that before.
        <p style="Text-align: center; margin-right: ($spacer * 1); padding: 10px:">	One day my friend and I decided to hangout after finding we live relatively close. Although we were happy to find that out, we realized there's not much to do in deep Brooklyn. We could travel an hour to go into the city, but where's the fun in that? Instead we decided to make no plan but to bike around and see if there's anything fun to find.
        <p style="Text-align: center; margin-right: ($spacer * 0.5) ; padding: 10px:"> After meeting we traveled a block or so and were greeted by this lovely park that was evidently new. Little to no trash and beautiful trees made up most of it. There were a good amount of people there so we decided to see if there was anything else interesting in this place. We passed through the park, a soccer field, a construction area and then reached a secluded area. We parted the tree branches in our way and saw a striking view. It was an open area leading to rocks that just touched the bay water and a gorgeous opening to the Verrazzano Bbridge. It crossed over the surprisingly blue water and clear blue sky. We stayed there for hours taking in the view. It was surprising to me to find such a nice place in NYC. The place known for the messiness and dirtiness, had another side to it that I rarely see, and luckily it wasn't the last.
        <p style="Text-align: center; margin-right: ($spacer * 1,5) !important; padding: 10px:">Time passed until I met the same friend again. We could have chosen to meet in the same area, but why not explore again? We went to this park that didn't have much to it. There were a couple run down baseball fields and an occupied soccer field. After hanging around there for a bit we noticed a hole in the fence. We wondered what it could lead to and neither of us had a clue so we had to discover it. We both went through and were so surprised with what we found. It was a clean and collected golf course that had gorgeous trees that surrounded it making it quite secluded. We walked some more by going down a slight hill and saw yet another memorable view. We see a brightly lit up Verrazzano bridge in the dark night. We were so shocked to see something like this again. The only sounds we heard were the rustling trees and faint honks in the background. It was peaceful and an experience I'll never forget.
        <p style="Text-align: center; margin-right: ($spacer * 1.5) !important; padding: 1000px:">	That bridge played such an important part in my interpretation of New York City. It has always been something around that I never fully noticed till recently. So many people will see it as just another bridge connecting two boroughs, but I will see it as all those experiences individually. All the different times with just one thing in common. The Verrazzano bridge is more than just a way to get from Brooklyn to Staten Island, it is a view to remember.
